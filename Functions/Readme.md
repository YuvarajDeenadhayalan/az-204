# Azure Functions trigger and binding example
# Suppose you want to write a new row to Azure Table storage whenever a new message appears in Azure Queue storage. This scenario can be implemented using an Azure Queue storage trigger and an Azure Table storage output binding.
# The first element in the bindings array is the Queue storage trigger. The type and direction properties identify the trigger. The name property identifies the function parameter that receives the queue message content. The name of the queue to monitor is in queueName, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by connection.

# The second element in the bindings array is the Azure Table Storage output binding. The type and direction properties identify the binding. The name property specifies how the function provides the new table row, in this case by using the function return value. The name of the table is in tableName, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by connection.
